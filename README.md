# UI-UX-Experiment2

## Aim:
Design a clean, premium mobile shopping experience for Nexa Watches that highlights products, strengthens brand identity (gold + dusty-pink aesthetic), and converts visitors to buyers by making discovery, selection, and checkout fast, accessible, and delightful on small screens.

## Algorithm:

Step 1: Create a new square canvas (example: 800×800 px).

Step 2: Add a rectangle and apply a left-to-right warm gradient as the background.

Step 3: Add an oval shape, remove fill, increase border thickness, and color it dark brown.

Step 4: Resize and center the oval on the canvas.

Step 5: Search for a rolling-pin graphic, insert it, recolor it brown, and place it at the center.

Step 6: Search for a chef-hat graphic, insert it, recolor it brown, and place it above the “B” area.

Step 7: Add a text box and type “Auro”, choose a serif font, color it brown, and place it above the main title.

Step 8: Add another text box, type “Bakery”, choose a bold serif/display font, color it brown, and enlarge it to be the main title.

Step 9: Add a small text box for the tagline “BAKING WARMTH INTO EVERY LOAF”.

Step 10: Apply the curve effect to the tagline and adjust the curve to match the bottom of the oval.

Step 11: Center the tagline under the rolling pin inside the oval.

Step 12: Search for a wheat or leaf graphic, insert it, recolor it brown, and place it on the right side overlapping the oval.

Step 13: Align and adjust spacing so all elements are visually balanced.

Step 14: Ensure all graphics and text use the same brown color for consistency.

Step 15: Export the final design (PNG recommended).

## Output:

<img width="567" height="566" alt="Screenshot 2025-09-03 105105" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/23f2fac9-7f6e-4490-ba96-307b74e20bdb" />

## Result:
The Auro Bakery logo delivers a warm and inviting brand identity with its soft gradient background, handcrafted illustrations, and rich brown tones, creating a homely and artisan feel; the elements are well-balanced, the typography is elegant, and the overall design clearly reflects a bakery that values comfort, warmth, and quality in every loaf.
